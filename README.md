This is a slightly modified version of `https://github.com/ejholmes/vagrant-heroku` adapted
to my needs

## Easy install

Add the following to your `Vagrantfile`.

```ruby
Vagrant::Config.run do |config|
  config.vm.box = "heroku"
  config.vm.box_url = "https://gist.github.com/a6574dccd437ccfdec97"
end
```

And run `vagrant up`. The box will be downloaded and imported for you.

### Extra

You can use this Vagrantfile and vm bash script to easily have your env up and
running:

`https://gist.github.com/bff38eebbd52008553ef`

## Building From Scratch

First, clone the repo and install gems with bundler.

```bash
$ git clone git@github.com:elcuervo/vagrant-heroku.git
$ cd vagrant-heroku
$ bundle install
```

Next, build the box with veewee. Go grab a cup of coffee because this is gonna
take a while.

```bash
$ bundle exec veewee vbox export heroku
$ vagrant box add heroku heroku.box
```

Now all you have to do is setup vagrant in your project.

```bash
$ vagrant init heroku
$ vagrant up
$ vagrant ssh
```
