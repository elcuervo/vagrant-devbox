This is a slightly modified version of `https://github.com/ejholmes/vagrant-heroku` adapted
to my needs

## Vagrant
Make sure you have the latest Vagrant version installed http://docs.vagrantup.com/v2/installation/

## Easy install
Add the following to your `Vagrantfile`.

```ruby
Vagrant::Config.run do |config|
  config.vm.box = "devbox"
  config.vm.box_url = "https://www.dropbox.com/s/jn3w4kpn644kwwt/devbox.box"
end
```

And run `vagrant up`. The box will be downloaded and imported for you.

### Extra

You can use this Vagrantfile and vm bash script to easily have your env up and
running:

## Building From Scratch

First, clone the repo and install gems with bundler.

```bash
$ git clone git@github.com:elcuervo/vagrant-devbox.git
$ cd vagrant-devbox
$ bundle install
```

Next, build the box with veewee. Go grab a cup of coffee because this is gonna
take a while.

```bash
$ bundle exec veewee vbox export devbox
$ vagrant box add devbox devbox.box
```

Now all you have to do is setup vagrant in your project.

```bash
$ vagrant init devbox
$ vagrant up
$ vagrant ssh
```
